# CRLF to LF

This script converts the line endings of files from CRLF to LF. Only files with specific name endings are converted.

Run the script in a folder to convert all accepted files in that folder and in all accepted subfolders.

You may want to customize the `folders_to_exclude` and `file_suffixes_to_include` lists. They control which files and folders to run on.
